🧑‍💻 3. What would you do if a user reports that their system is slow or not booting properly?
Answer:
First, I check for high CPU/RAM usage, background processes, and startup programs. 
If it’s not booting, I troubleshoot using safe mode or recovery tools, 
check for hardware faults (like RAM or HDD issues), and restore the system using a backup or image if required.

✅system booting issues:
If a system is not booting, first I check the power connection, cables, and display. 
Then I verify the hardware components like SMPS, RAM and hard disk are properly connected. 
I check BIOS settings and boot order, and if the system powers on but OS doesn’t load, I perform startup repair or use Safe Mode. If it’s a hardware issue, I replace or escalate it to the concerned team.

✅If a laptop or desktop is not turning on,
 I first check the power source, power cable, and adapter connection. 
 Then I check the battery or SMPS, and verify if any lights or fan activity is present. 
 I also reseat the RAM and power cables, and test with another power source. 
 If there’s still no response, I suspect a hardware issue like motherboard or power supply failure and escalate it to the hardware team.
