✅✅ LAN Troubleshooting – Brief Summary
⦁	Check LAN cable, port lights, and switch/router connection.
⦁	Ensure Ethernet adapter is enabled.
⦁	Verify IP using ipconfig (check gateway & DNS).
⦁	Ping gateway and server to test connectivity.
⦁	Update or reinstall LAN driver.
⦁	Disable/enable the adapter or change cable/port.

✅✅ Wi-Fi Troubleshooting – Brief Summary
⦁	Ensure Wi-Fi is ON and airplane mode is OFF.
⦁	Forget and reconnect to Wi-Fi network.
⦁	Restart router and check if other devices connect.
⦁	Check IP address and renew IP.
⦁	Improve signal strength (move closer to router).
⦁	Update/reinstall Wi-Fi driver.
⦁	Reset network settings if needed.


📶 Difference Between 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz Wi-Fi Bands
Feature	2.4 GHz (2.5G)	5 GHz
Speed	Slower (up to 450 Mbps) 	Faster (up to 1300 Mbps or more)
Range	Longer range – covers more area 	Shorter range – covers smaller area
Interference	More interference (shared with Bluetooth, microwaves, etc.)	Less interference – cleaner signal

✅✅1. Internet not working — how do you troubleshoot?

First, I check physical connectivity like LAN cable or Wi-Fi status.
Then I run ipconfig to verify IP, gateway, and DNS.
Next, I ping the gateway, 8.8.8.8, and a website to find where it breaks.
I flush DNS, reset network adapter, or reconfigure IP if needed.
If the issue persists, I check router/ISP status.

✅✅2. What is DNS and why is it important?

DNS translates domain names into IP addresses so browsers can locate websites.
Without DNS, users cannot open websites even if the internet works.
Common DNS issues cause “server not found” or slow browsing.
Troubleshooting includes flushing DNS or changing to Google DNS.
DNS is critical for smooth internet access.

✅✅3. What is DHCP? How does it work?

DHCP automatically assigns IP, mask, gateway, and DNS to clients.
It avoids manual configuration and prevents IP conflicts.
When a device joins a network, it sends a DHCP Discover request.
The DHCP server responds and assigns an available IP.
This makes network management simple and scalable.

✅✅4. Connected to Wi-Fi but no internet — how do you fix?

First, I check if the device has a valid IP or APIPA (169.x.x.x).
Then I ping the gateway and DNS to see where it fails.
I flush DNS, reset TCP/IP stack, or reconnect Wi-Fi.
Check if proxy or firewall settings block the internet.
If everything is fine locally, I check router/ISP issues.

✅✅5. Public IP vs Private IP — explain.

Private IPs are used inside local networks and cannot be accessed from the internet.
Public IPs are assigned by ISP and allow global communication.
Private IP ranges include 192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x, 172.16.x.x.
Public IP is unique on the internet.
Private IP is for internal communication only.

✅✅6. How do you check network connectivity?

I start with ipconfig to verify network configuration.
Use ping to check reachability to gateway and external servers.
Tracert helps identify where the packet drops on the route.
Nslookup helps check DNS resolution.
All these tools help isolate the exact point of failure.

✅✅7. What is VPN and why is it used?

VPN creates a secure encrypted tunnel over public internet.
Companies use VPN for remote employees to access internal resources safely.
It protects data from interception.
Useful for secure RDP, file access, and applications.
VPN ensures privacy and security while working remotely.

✅✅8. What is APIPA and when does it occur?

APIPA address (169.254.x.x) is assigned when DHCP fails to provide an IP.
It means the system cannot communicate with the router or DHCP server.
Devices with APIPA cannot access the internet.
It is common due to cable issues, router problems, or DHCP service failure.
Solution: restart adapter, check DHCP, or configure IP manually.

✅✅9. How do you identify ISP-level issues?

If gateway ping is successful but ping to 8.8.8.8 fails, it indicates ISP issue.
I check router lights and WAN status.
Restart the router/ONT to refresh connection.
Test using another device or hotspot for comparison.
If still unresolved, escalate to ISP with diagnostics.

✅✅10. Explain Gateway and its role.

A gateway routes traffic from local network to external networks (internet).
Without a gateway, systems only communicate within LAN.
It is usually the router’s IP (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
Gateway determines where to send outbound traffic.
It is essential for internet access.
