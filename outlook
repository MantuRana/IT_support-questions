✅ What is Microsoft Outlook? (Interview Answer)

Microsoft Outlook is an email client and personal information manager used to manage emails, contacts, calendars, tasks, and meetings. 
It is widely used in organizations for communication and scheduling. 
Outlook is part of the Microsoft Office suite and works with Exchange Server, Microsoft 365, IMAP, and POP email accounts.

⭐•	How do You take backup in Microsoft Outlook ?

“To take a backup in Outlook, I export the mailbox to a PST file using File → Open & Export → Import/Export → Export to a File → Outlook Data File (.PST). 
Then I choose the folders to back up, select a location, and save the PST.”

✅ Difference Between IMAP and POP & Function of SMTP?
“IMAP keeps emails on the server and syncs them across all devices, while POP downloads emails to the local device and removes them from the server. 
IMAP is modern and supports multi-device access; POP is older and local-only.
Default Port
143 / 993 (SSL)
110 / 995 (SSL)

⭐ 2. What is the Function of SMTP?
SMTP is used for sending outgoing emails from the client to the mail server and between servers. 
IMAP is used to receive and sync emails from the server, 
while POP downloads emails to the local system without synchronization.

✅ If a user is facing sending/receiving issues in Outlook, how do you resolve it?

If a user can’t send or receive emails in Outlook, I first check the internet and ensure Outlook is not in offline mode. 
Then I verify server settings—IMAP/POP/SMTP ports and authentication. I check the Outbox for stuck mails, repair the Outlook profile, 
clear cache, and disable antivirus if it’s blocking SMTP. If the issue persists, 
I recreate a new Outlook profile and reconfigure the account.”

⭐ “If a PST file is corrupted?

 I first take a backup and then run Microsoft’s Inbox Repair Tool (ScanPST.exe) to repair it. 
If it repairs partially, I create a new PST and import recovered data. If ScanPST cannot fix it, 
I use a third-party PST repair tool to extract the emails. This way, I recover maximum mailbox data safely.”
