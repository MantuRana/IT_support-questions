##✅ Interview Answer: How to Setup a Network Printer (Windows)

Ensure the printer is connected to the network using Wi-Fi or LAN cable and confirm both printer and PC are on the same network.

Check the printer’s IP address from the printer’s network settings.

On the system, I go to Settings → Bluetooth & devices → Printers & scanners and click Add device.

If Windows doesn’t detect it, I choose Add manually and select
‘Add a printer using a IP address’.

Install the correct printer driver, either automatically or through the official manufacturer website.

Finally, I print a test page to verify that the printer is installed and working properly
