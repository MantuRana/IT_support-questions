Ensure the printer is connected to the network using Wi-Fi or LAN cable and confirm both printer and PC are on the same network.
Check the printer’s IP address from the printer’s network settings.
after that I will go to Settings → Bluetooth & devices → Printers & scanners and click Add device.
If Windows doesn’t detect it, I choose Add manually and select
‘Add a printer using a IP address’.

Install the correct printer driver, either automatically or through the official manufacturer website.
Finally, I print a test page to verify that the printer is installed and working properly
